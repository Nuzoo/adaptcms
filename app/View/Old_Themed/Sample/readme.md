# Sample

This is a sample theme that developers can use as a base to create their own AdaptCMS theme. In this install we include install/uninstall docs, some data to be pre-loaded upon installation (a sample article and field) and a few modified templates. You can remove the pre-loaded items or docs by editing the theme.json file.

## Installation

To install, first download the zip and unpack the folder 'Sample' into your 'app/View/Old_Themed' folder - be sure to chmod this new folder to 755. Then login into your admin panel and click on 'Appearance'. You should see this theme listed and an option to install on the right side.
Simply click that and click continue on the install. After that, you can mess around with the theme and see what kind of theme you would want to make.
